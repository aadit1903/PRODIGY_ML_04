## PRODIGY_ML_04
Introduction:   
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model using machine learning techniques to classify different hand gestures from image or video data. This model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and supports gesture-based control systems for various applications.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):    
Through EDA, I examined gesture patterns, visualized gesture distributions, and analyzed key features in the dataset. This helped guide model selection by highlighting important aspects of gesture data, such as hand shape and position, that could improve classification accuracy.
